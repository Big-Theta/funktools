    """Mixin that makes it easier to write a class-based decorator with optional kwargs.

    Decorators that use this mixin only need to define an __init__ function and a __call__ function.

    For classes that will use this mixin:

        __init__ will always receive the the function that is being decorated followed by any
        keyword arguments given to the decorator.

        __call__ will always receive the call arguments given directly to the decorated function.

    Decorators may be defined as follows:

        class _FooDecorator:
            def __init__(fn, bar=None):
                self._fn = fn

            def __call__(*args,  **kwargs):
                self._fn(*args, **kwargs


        foo_decorator = type('foo_decorator', (DecoratorMixin, _FooDecorator), {})

    and then may be used in any of the following manners:

        @foo_decorator
        def foo():
            ...

        @foo_decorator()
        def foo():
            ...

        @foo_decorator(bar='bar')
        def foo():
            ...
    """
    pass
